FrontEnd NanoDegree Mobile PORTFOLIO:

 Website Performance Optimization portfolio project:

In this project we have to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, we need to optimize the critical rendering path in the javascript file and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the following methods:

1. First Of all open the file index.html and view the content and linked files in it.

Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html:

1. In this we need to make the CSS file internal rather than external.
2. Compress the images so that it helps in rendering the pages more fast.

Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html:

1. To optimize views/pizza.html, we need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher.
2. We need to compress the images and the javascript file in it.
3. Changes are made in the main.js file to help render the page.
